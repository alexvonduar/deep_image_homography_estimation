# deep image homography estimation
This code is writen by jupyter notebook with keras to implement this paper:
DeTone D, Malisiewicz T, Rabinovich A. Deep image homography estimation[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.03798, 2016.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03798

This model is build on this proiect:  https://github.com/alexhagiopol/deep_homography_estimation

train:
You should put all the jpg images into the test_images directory.
if you want to train the whole model , you can change steps_per_epoch to adjust iterations.

test:
if you don't want to train the whole model ,you can get a pretrained model from here:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B88aZDadyYr8TTBSY3JvYTVKVnc
